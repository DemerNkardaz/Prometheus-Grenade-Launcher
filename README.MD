A 40mm caliber grenade launcher designed as handheld weapon, stationary turret and version of spidertron, featuring a variety of ammunition types.

It is a part of the upcoming “Plastordance” modification and is an exemplary of Ferrolyths weaponry in my fictional universe

Recommend using turrets at a distance from main structures to minimize potential damage. The turret has a range of 25-80 and rotation is limited to a quarter of a circle.

### Strategy

It is better to use different grenade types in your defense.
Using of one-two types is not bad, but when using more types, there is greater effectiveness.
